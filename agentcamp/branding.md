# Branding Assets and Design Guidelines
These guidelines are designed to help you understand and apply our brand identity consistently across all touchpoints.

## Logo

When using the logo, ensure it is clearly visible, uncluttered, and has adequate surrounding space. The logo should always be displayed in its original proportions, never stretch, compress, or alter the design in any way.
