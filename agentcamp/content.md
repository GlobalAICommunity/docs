## Session

### Build and launch AI agents fast with Microsoft Foundry and the AI Toolkit
*45 minute breakout session*  

Build & ship AI agents fast with Microsoft Foundry Models and Azure. Prototype with open models, scale with Foundry models, & streamline workflows with AI Toolkit in VS Code. Experiment with models & prompts, evaluate agent responses, & move from prototype to cloud with cutting-edge developer tools.

## Workshops

### 1. Building AI Chat Agents with LangChain, Chainlit & GitHub Models
*A 90-minute hands-on workshop*

Welcome to this practical workshop where you'll build a fully functional AI chat agent from scratch! By the end of this session, you'll have created an intelligent assistant that can have conversations, call external tools (like fetching weather data), and integrate with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### 3. Build a Pizza Ordering Agent with Microsoft Foundry and MCP
*A 90-minute hands-on workshop*
In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn to build domain-specific AI agents with Foundry Agent Service. Starting from a simple agent, you’ll add system prompts, custom instructions, and knowledge with RAG. You’ll extend it with tool calling (like a pizza calculator) and connect external services via MCP for live menu and order handling. By the end, you’ll have a working Contoso PizzaBot that can answer questions, recommend pizzas, and manage orders.

### 4. Snake Bot Hack Tournament

*A 1-2 hour competitive bot-coding competition*

In this interactive hack session, you will compete against other teams to build the best bot to play a 2-version version of the classic Snake game. Come up with a strategy to win, and use any tools at your disposal to build an automated bot. Watch the knockout tournament live in your browser, and the last surviving bot is declared the winner!

### 5. Prototyping multimodal agents with Microsoft Foundry and the AI Toolkit
*A 90-minute hands-on workshop*   

In this lab, you'll get hands-on with the AI Toolkit (AITK) and Microsoft Foundry in VS Code to explore and compare the frontier multimodal and reasoning models from the Model Catalog. Learn how to augment models for a real-world business scenario, using prompt and context engineering. Prototype an agent using the AITK Agent Builder, and equip the agent with the right tools via the Model context Protocol (MCP).
