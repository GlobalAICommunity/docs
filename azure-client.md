### Unable to find your subscription?
- Your subscription is created in the Tenant/Directory: "Global AI Community (gaicevents.onmicrosoft.com)"
- Sometimes you need to switch tenants, before you see the subscription. [Click here](https://portal.azure.com/#settings/directory) to switch Directory.
- Sometimes you need to adjust your [Subscription filter](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBladeV2) for the subscription to show up.
