## 🚀 New Announcements & Updates

We are thrilled to roll out several new initiatives designed to make your life as a Chapter Lead easier and more productive.

### 1. Canva Pro for Chapter Leads

We are officially providing **Canva Pro subscriptions** to all chapter leads! You no longer need to be a professional designer to create stunning visuals for your events.

* **Brand Kit:** Access Global AI colors, fonts, and logos directly within Canva.
* **One-Click Branding:** Instantly transform templates into branded assets.
* **AI Tools:** Utilize Canva’s AI features, background remover, and more.
* **How to get it:** Email using your Global AI chapter lead email to [support@globalai.community](mailto:support@globalai.community) with the subject "Canva Pro Access".



### 2. Global AI Discord Server
While Slack remains our internal hub for Chapter Leads, our **[new Discord server](https://discord.gg/NMryZKPC3m)** is the place to connect with your community members.
* **Dedicated Channels:** Each chapter (e.g., Hyderabad, Los Angeles) gets its own channel to engage with local attendees before and after events.
* **Verified Status:** Introduce yourself in the "Introduction" section. Once verified, you will receive a special Global AI icon next to your name.

We are preparing to launch a new developer-focused show! Chapter leads will get the first look and the opportunity to apply as speakers. Stay tuned for more details.
