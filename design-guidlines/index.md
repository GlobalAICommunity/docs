# Branding Assets and Design Guidelines

<!-- ![Global AI Community Logo](/global-AI-community.png) -->

## Introduction

These guidelines are designed to help you understand and apply our brand identity consistently across all touchpoints. Our brand represents innovation, accessibility, and the transformative potential of artificial intelligence for the global community.

The elements outlined in these guidelines—from our logo to typography, colors, and visual language—work together to create a cohesive brand experience. These standards ensure that our community remains recognizable and maintains a professional presence across all platforms and mediums.

Please familiarize yourself with these guidelines and refer to them when creating materials that represent our global AI community. Consistency in our visual identity strengthens recognition and trust among our members and partners worldwide.

## Logo

Our community logo serves as our most recognizable symbol and should be used consistently across all applications. The logo has been carefully designed to reflect our mission and values while maintaining versatility across various media.

When using the logo, ensure it is clearly visible, uncluttered, and has adequate surrounding space. The logo should always be displayed in its original proportions—never stretch, compress, or alter the design in any way. For optimal legibility, maintain a minimum size as specified in these guidelines.

The logo is available in several formats for different applications. Use the full-color version on light backgrounds and the monochrome version when color reproduction is limited or for special applications.
