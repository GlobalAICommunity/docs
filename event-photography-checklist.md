# Event Photography Checklist

Capturing great photos is key to telling the story of our events — from the energy of the crowd to the passion on stage and the little moments in between.  
Use this checklist to make sure we document the full experience — the people, the atmosphere, and the brand.  

## Shots to Capture

1. **Crowd at registration desk** — capture people collecting badges and entering the venue.  
2. **Venue setup before start** — clean wide shot showing stage, branding, and seating.  
3. **Opening note or keynote on stage** — speaker in action + audience engaged.  
4. **Group picture/selfie with all attendees** — take right after opening note/keynote (when everyone’s present).  
5. **Every speaker on stage** — 4–5 good angles per speaker, logo visible if possible.  
6. **Audience listening or reacting** — people taking notes, smiling, or clapping.  
7. **Candid networking shots** — attendees chatting, shaking hands, exchanging cards.  
8. **People enjoying food or coffee** — natural moments during breaks.  
9. **Hands-on or interactive activities** — capture any workshop, demo, or engagement.  
10. **Speakers or attendees near event branding** — banners, selfie booth, backdrop, etc.  
11. **Group picture of all speakers on stage** — ensure event logo is clearly visible.  
12. **Volunteers or organizers in action** — behind-the-scenes coordination moments.  
13. **Event signage and branding** — close-ups of logos, banners, and sponsor walls.  
14. **Candid smiles and laughs** — capture the overall vibe and energy.  
15.  **Closing stage moment** — final applause or thank-you session shot.  

## Tips for Great Shots

- Always include event **branding or logo** where possible.  
- Mix **wide**, **medium**, and **close-up** shots for storytelling variety.  
- Capture **horizontal and vertical** photos (for web + social).  
- Make sure **every speaker and key organizer** appears in at least one photo.  
- Most importantly — **capture the energy, connection, and excitement** of the event!
