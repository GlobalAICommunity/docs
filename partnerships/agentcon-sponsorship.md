# AgentCon Sponsorship

## Purpose

AgentCon Sponsorship enables organizations to support local [AgentCon](http://agentcon.dev/) events — the Global AI Community's developer conference focused on AI Agents — while gaining targeted visibility and engagement with an audience of AI developers, data scientists, and professionals.

AgentCon events are free for attendees, attracting a minimum of **150 participants** per event across multiple global waves. Sponsors play a vital role in making these high-quality, community-driven conferences possible.

## Why Sponsor AgentCon?

- **Targeted Developer Audience**: AgentCon attendees are actively building with AI agent frameworks, tools, and infrastructure — a highly relevant audience for AI-focused organizations.
- **Global Footprint**: AgentCon runs across multiple waves worldwide, with events hosted by 175+ Global AI chapters. Sponsoring gives you reach into local developer ecosystems on every continent.
- **On-Site Presence**: Events include dedicated space for sponsor booths and networking, providing direct engagement with attendees.
- **Brand Alignment**: Associate your brand with cutting-edge AI agent technology and a community-first, diversity-committed ecosystem.
- **Free-to-Attend Model**: Your sponsorship directly enables free access for all attendees, generating goodwill and positive brand association.

## Pricing

The sponsorship fee is **€3,000 per event**.

Sponsors committing to **6 or more events** are recognized as a **Global AgentCon Sponsor**, gaining additional visibility across the entire AgentCon programme.
